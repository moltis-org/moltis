# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **TLS HTTP redirect port** now defaults to `gateway_port + 1` instead of
  the hardcoded port `18790`. This makes the Dockerfile simpler (both ports
  are adjacent) and avoids collisions when running multiple instances.
  Override via `[tls] http_redirect_port` in `moltis.toml` or the
  `MOLTIS_TLS__HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT` environment variable.

- **TLS certificates use `moltis.localhost` domain.** Auto-generated server
  certs now include `moltis.localhost`, `*.moltis.localhost`, `localhost`,
  `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` as SANs. Banner and redirect URLs use
  `https://moltis.localhost:<port>` when bound to loopback, so the cert
  matches the displayed URL. Existing certs are automatically regenerated
  on next startup.

- **Certificate validity uses dynamic dates.** Cert `notBefore`/`notAfter`
  are now computed from the current system time instead of being hardcoded.
  CA certs are valid for 10 years, server certs for 1 year from generation.

### Fixed

- **WebSocket origin validation** now treats `.localhost` subdomains
  (e.g. `moltis.localhost`) as loopback equivalents per RFC 6761.
